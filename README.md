# GDD-MiniGame-StopFeedingMeGrandma
This is a mini game I made using Unity with C#. This is just the code and assets of the game. 
> Link of the game is [Here](https://roshianna.github.io/GDD1-StopFeedingMeGrandma/).

All the pictures and musics I used are from the internet, I do not own them, but the code I wrote and the sound effect I recorded by myself. 

Have fun!
